A trailer was released to announce the Halloween Event on September 29, 2019. The event officially began on October 1st and was held in a swamp biome between the Mewffin Isles and the Crutionix Public Use Guardian Farm. The trailer features the original Halloween Town setup before being opened to the public, as prepared by OnyonSwomp and Crutionix. Halloween Town featured several 3D pixel arts, including a giant pumpkin and skull, along with custom trees and a slime wearing a witches hat.<br><br>The event was advertised to include activities for server members to enjoy including a build competition that would last the entire month of October and an event where the time of day would be halted at dusk, to be held on October 31st. Special decorative heads were also advertised as being available for a limited time during the event. This event marks the first time that users could teleport to an open, accessible space. Previously teleports were reserved for in-game user polling, which only provides a teleport in and out of the polling location.<br><br>The top three finalists were Meagansan2000 (1st), Blue__Sparrow (2nd) and Eternaldoom (3rd), as pictured below:</p>

It occurred on April 26, 2019 and lead to the server adding a whitelist to prevent players from adding unless they requested to play. The Grief involved many buildings being destroyed, partially destroyed or damaged. It was the first time the server was rolled back to a backup save and the only time that the server was rolled back to a backup save outside of moderation testing for game updates and features.</span><br><br>The Grief was instigated by two members that were given the IP from someone inside of The Nutty Terrarium Discord server, when the server was public for anyone to play within the Discord. The players were later identified as being friends of aHoboAteMyDog.<br><br>The Grief took place on April 26, 2019 between 10:00am and 2:46pm. The destruction was documented by several players in the form of screenshots. The notable buildings that were griefed included:<br><br>The Solanum Hotel<br>H4v0c_x_S4nTA and meagansan2000's House<br>The Spawn Museum<br>Glowe6958's House<br>FriedOrange79's starter base.<br></p>

It is unsure who instigated the Battle of Solanum Fields, however it is likely that Portugal officially began the conflict as a reaction to the increasing threat of military pillagers gathering close to the city.<br><br>The battle was an overwhelming loss for the Pillager Military, losing every available troop for battle. Portugal did not lose a single civilian or military troop during the war due to the advanced armour and medical items at their disposal. The Portuguese Military consisted of the leader of Portugal, Eternaldoom, fusionedge, FriedOrange79 and the leader of Ruleskeid, Crutionix.<br></p>

It was considered a humorous occurrence for some time between June 6 to 16, 2019 until the threat had grown to a state too large to be handled by the Portuguese military alone.<br><br>The threat continued to grow between June 16 until June 28 when plans for defense began forming after FriedOrange79 elevated concerns about the growing threat.<br><br><strong>Ruleskeid Response</strong><br>The nearby village of Ruleskeid also experienced threats from the Pillager Military however it was on a much smaller scale. As a result of this threat, walls were constructed to the western side of Ruleskeid, to protect the village from any attacks and limit entry into the village from just two points along the western border. The wall proved to be effective and no conflict was raised after it was constructed.<br><br>As a result of this threat, the leader of Ruleskeid, Crutionix, pledged assistance to Portugal in the event of any conflict with the Pillager military.<br><br><strong>Course of the Battle</strong><br>The first casualty marked the official start of the battle. The first pillager militia was slain on July 1, 2019. Over the following hours, many other pillagers were slain by eternaldoom, fusionedge and FriedOrange79. Further to the North-East of the battle there were more pillagers that seemed to be drifting in the direction of Portugal. These were closer to Ruleskeid and were taken care of by Crutionix. Over the following days, more pillager militia were discovered and slain accordingly.<br><br>The battle was officially declared a victory for Portugal on July 5, 2019 when there were little to no pillagers found in the area.<br></p>

Despite this, a threat has not been considered. The city of Portugal went on to found the Feitoria and hold an event where local wines were served to visitors. There were no Pillagers present at this celebratory event.<br><br></p>

It is unknown what the chances are of this happening.<br><br>He remained in this location until he was stolen by a removed member of the server. He was later recovered and moved to the Mewffin Isles where he resided for some time before being finally relocated to a secret location by Crutionix.<br><br>Reginald was named after FriedOrange79's nickname in Facebook Messenger with Crutionix. The name tag was supplied by FriedOrange.&nbsp;<br><br>Reginald produced many eggs in his time standing between the portal and wall and many of those were hatched. It is unknown how many siblings he has. Reginald the Second is a chicken that was slain by FriedOrange79 at the Age of Empires base by eternaldoom however there doesn't seem to be a relation between the two. He is quite the iconic member of the server, being featured in many streams.<br></p>
