She created a village south west of Solanum in a forest biome that bordered the southern side of the desert, containing the first mob farm. The village is split into two different sides, with completely different styles. Half of the village was filled with cottages, surrounding a giant lake. The other side was a desert inspired expansion featuring middle eastern architecture cues. The desert side of the village bordered Portugal and was a favourite among server enthusiasts.<br></p>

Construction of the basic infrastructure, custom trees and board walks were undergone by OnyonSwomp and Crutionix in the September prior to the event.</p>
