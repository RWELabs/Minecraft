# Custom Villagers
The custom villagers code in this directory is for use on The Baked Potatarium Minecraft server. These custom villagers provide the players the opportunity to buy decorative small blocks using player head texture NBT data.

### Marketplace Villagers
Marketplace Villagers are those that trade decorative miniature blocks for players to use as decorations. These include logs, stones, decorative blocks and more. These villagers reside at the community market at Spawn.

### Event Villagers
Event villagers are special custom villagers for events that are to be or have been held on TBP Minecraft Server. For example, during the Halloween Event there was an Event Trader (event_trader_halloween.mcfunction) that offered halloween themed trades.

Each event villager has their own token used as currency. This is in a separate file named identically with _token at the end. For example
- event_trader_halloween.mcfunction = Event Trader Villager Spawn Command
- event_trader_halloween_token.mcfunction = Currency Spawn Command

### Demo Villagers
These files are for debugging and spawn villagers that have modified or unfinished code and shouldn't be used.

### Template
The template (template.mfunction) is not designed to be used as a tutorial. This is a template for filling player head data.
